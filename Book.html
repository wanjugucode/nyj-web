 <h2>ABEL MARRYING PATRICIA</h2>


 <p>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife, I wondered 
   why he ever<br> married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was 
   the opposite of that in <br>every way...", Trevor says.
 </p>
<p>
  
In the book<b> BORN A CRIME </b>by Trevor Noah, we see that Abel  was
a traditional man <br>and he made a mistake to marry a woman who was
 not ready to make a subservient, she<br> was an independent, modern woman, and 
 this was the reason why they never got along.<br>
Abel was only worried about what his friends and his family would 
say. He didn’t care <br> about the well-being of his family.
 He wanted to impress his friends, family, and <br> everyone else instead of 
 adjusting to living in harmony with his wife.
 <p> He was indeed a dictator and a traditional man whereas Patricia was the
    opposite of that. <br>Patricia did not also  make the right decision. I 
    am very sure that she knew the dark side <br>of Abel. she  wouldn’t  have 
    given him hand in marriage to prevent the
    kind of drama she <br>experienced.
</p>
<p>
In real life,  Abel and Patricia marriage is an example of how decision-making
 affects<br>  our life. We should be able to see ahead and also if by any chance we
  make a wrong <br> decision we should not be too rigid,we should pivot and keep going 
  since life is a battle,<br>  we fight with imposter, nature, and failures but only 
  the strong succeed

  <h2>HUMOR IN BORN A CRIME BY TREVOR NOAH</h2>
 <p>Noah used humor to describe his humble background, his personality, and
    dramatic events that happened in his life.</p>
   <p>
    Humor helped Noah and his family heal for instance when his mother was 
    shot and almost died. Noah says, "yeah even during this time, and I did
     not find any humor in that. She was the first to make a joke. My mom 
     looks at me and she goes, ‘shh, Trevor shh, don’t crybaby. I look on our
      bright side. what is the bright side? At least now, because of my nose,
       you are officially the best-looking person in the family. And we still 
       joke about it to this day.
     I see people look at me with pity when I tell these stories .”
  </p>
 <p>
  Abel could refuse to fix Patricia’s car but Noah made fun of that by saying,"
   You are married to a mechanic and you are going to get your car fixed? that 
   is worse than cheating."
  </p> 
  <p>
    Humor also helped Noah to make friends for especially when he moved to 
    the new school he was hilarious he uses humor to describe his character,
     For instance, he says, “Part of my success as the tuck-shop was that I
      was welcome everywhere, and everywhere because I was nobody I was the 
      acne-ridden clown with duck feet in floppy shoes." "I never overstayed
       my welcome. I wasn’t popular but I wasn’t an outcast.
      I was everywhere with everybody at the same time I was all by myself."
