    <h1 id=about>ABOUT ME</h1>
   
    <p>I  was  born  into a literate ,humble family in Mukurwe-ini
      constituency in Nyeri County.</br> I am second to last among several siblings.
     I started my primary education in a Mweru </br>primary school 
    in Mukurwe-ini and after my K.C.P.E, I joined Gatugi Girl High
    school</br> in Othaya and 
        completed my secondary school education in Giathugu secondary school </br>
        in Mukurwe-ini
      . In 2021 I enrolled in the codeHive  program
      which is now ongoing.</p>
    <p>I am a kind hearted caring individual that looks out for other,I am able 
      to keep calm and </br>level head whenever am in a situation of stress.I
       would like to consider myself as someone</br> who can relate to anyone and
        any culture and background.It allows me to make very personal 
        connection with everyone I meet and lastly I would say I am quiet 
        in crowd but not when I am </br>one on one with a person.</p>
  <p>My hobbies are reading, writing, dancing ,swimming, and exploring.</p>

  <p> I want to be remembered for changing people perception specifically to 
   tho who 
   underestimate their capability.</p>
